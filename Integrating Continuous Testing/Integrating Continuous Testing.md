## Non-Functional Tests

Non-functional tests are used to verify whether the other desired properties of an application are realized and that undesirable properties are not present.

# Flaky tests

Flaky tests are tests that fail with no evident change in code or configuration, or the code works on a local machine but fails with continuous integration. Upon retrying the test execution multiple times, the test eventually passes.

# Tips

- Make sure you  have more idea about Functional and nonfunctional testing
- How to use functional and nonfunctional testing in pipelines
- How to enable flaky tests which are causing the build randomly.
