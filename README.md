## Tips 
- **Divide and Conquer** — break the learning material down into thematic chapters

- **Use digital notes** — match the headings hierarchy with your breakdown of the training material

- **Treat the practice exams as training material** — I cannot stress this enough. THIS IS KEY. Also, make sure you don’t memorize the answers, try to understand the explanations

- **Seek out additional resources** - In addition to your primary study materials, consider looking for additional resources such as online courses, tutors, or study groups. These can provide valuable insights and help to reinforce your learning.

- **Check your Internet Speed** and make sure, it will not interrupt your exam if you are doing it from home/office.
Finally, make use of the ‘Mark for Review’ feature of the exam.

- **Please Don't use DUMPS**
